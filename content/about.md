About
=================

While building this website the following techniques have been used:

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){.bold-link}, a lightweight markup language created with the intention of it being easy to read and write, is used for writing the content.

- [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/){.bold-link}, a preprocessor for CSS, is used for handling the style.

- [Pico](https://picocms.org/){.bold-link}, a PHP based, flat-file CMS (Content Management System) is used for overall website management. It stores all the relevant information (content, configuration, styling) in files on the server (as opposed to in a database).

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/){.bold-link} provides the fonts.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/){.bold-link} provides the icons.
