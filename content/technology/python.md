Python
==========================

Python is a programming language launched in 1991 by Guido can Rossum. The programming language is dynamically typed and characterized as a general-purpose language since it can be applied in many domains.

The programming language is distinguished by all data types being based on classes and onjects. Another aspect that differentiates Python from other languages is that indentation is used to distinguish blocks within the code.

A program that prints out all even numbers between 1 and 100 could look like this in Python:

```python
for number in range(1, 100 + 1):
    if not number % 2:
        print(number)
```
