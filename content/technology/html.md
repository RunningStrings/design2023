HTML
==========================

HyperText Markup Language (HTML), together with HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), constitutes the foundation of the web. Web pages are written in HTML and are then sent over the internet using HTTP.

HTML describes the content and structure of our websites, and makes it possible to load other documents, such as CSS or JavaScript files.

HTML utilises elements described by tags. Below is an example of a paragraph containing a link:

```html
<p>A link to my <a href="mywebsite.html">website</a></p>
```
