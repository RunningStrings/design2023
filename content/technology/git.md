Git
==========================

Git is a distributed version control system created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. Git was created to manage changes to the Linux kernel.

Git being a distributed system means that no central repository is needed. However, a central repository is necessary if multiple developers want to collaborate on the same code.

Traditionally, Git is a CLI tool, but some GUI based tools have been developed to lower the threshold for getting started with Git.
