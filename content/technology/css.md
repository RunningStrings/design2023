CSS
==========================

Cascading Style Sheets is a language for describing the appearance of elements in a markup language, for example HTML. CSS is one of the three technologies that form the foundation of the web.

In CSS, we use selectors to describe which elements we want to affect and then we declare the style for these elements in a block.

For example, if we want to set the color for all paragraphs to blue, we do the following:

```css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```
