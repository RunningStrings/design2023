Colors
=======================

The aim of this report is to analyze the color palette and typograhy on three separate websites.

Selection
-----------------------

The websites I have chosen for analysis are:

- **[Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se/)**
- **[Linnaeus University](https://www.lnu.se/)**
- **[Lund University](https://www.lu.se/)**

<br>
My reasons for choosing these websites are twofold: They are all websites belonging to Swedish universities or institutes of higher education, and they also happen to be universities or institutes of which I am a current or former student. They all have their own individual profiles and histories, and seeing as there are obvious similarities but also differences, I thought that this could make for an interesting selection for comparison.

Method
-----------------------

My method for performing this analysis has been to utilise the **[ColorZilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/)** browser extension in [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) in order to acquire the colors used on each website in a concise and comprehensive manner, the **[Adobe Color Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)** to help analyse the different color schemes, the built-in developer tools in Mozilla Firefox to acquire typographical information, and I have used **[LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/)** to capture the front page of each website in its entirety.

Results
-----------------------

### Blekinge Institute of Technology

[![BTH Front Page](../image/bth_preview.png)](../image/bth_frontpage.png) {.screenshot-preview}

When using the ColorZilla tool, the following colors were found on the front page of the website of Blekinge Institute of Technology:

<table class="color-table">

<td style="background-color: #FDFDFD" class="dark">22</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFFFFF" class="dark">23</td>
</tr>
</table>

The color palette with neutral colors excluded:

![BTH Color Wheel](../image/bth_wheel.png) {.wheel}
<table class="color-table-small">
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #336699" class="light">#336699</td>
<td style="background-color: #055064" class="light">#055064</td>

<td style="background-color: #6996A2" class="dark">#6996A2</td>
<td style="background-color: #F08050" class="dark">#F08050</td>
</tr>
</table>

The color scheme is monochromatic with  the orange as a complementary color and a wide range of gray shades. 

The font used on the website is **[Averta](https://www.thedesignersfoundry.com/averta)**, a sans serif font designed by [Kostas Bartsokas](https://kostasbartsokas.com/). Averta is described as being modernist, neutral and friendly, and was created with versatility in mind.

| Element    | Font        |
|------------|-------------|
| H1:        | Averta      |
| H2:        | Averta Bold |
| Body text: | Averta      |

### Linnaeus University

[![Linnaeus University Front Page](../image/lnu_preview.png)](../image/lnu_frontpage.png) {.screenshot-preview}

When using the ColorZilla tool, the following colors were found on the front page of the website of Linnaeus University:

<table class="color-table">
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #100169" class="light">1</td>
<td style="background-color: #333300" class="light">2</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFE000" class="dark">3</td>
<td style="background-color: #EFD200" class="dark">4</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFE003" class="dark">5</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFDF05" class="dark">6</td>
<td style="background-color: #000" class="light">7</td>
<td style="background-color: #212121" class="light">8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #333333" class="light">9</td>
<td style="background-color: #666666" class="light">10</td>
<td style="background-color: #C7C7C7" class="dark">11</td>
<td style="background-color: #E6E6E6" class="dark">12</td>
<td style="background-color: #EBEBEB" class="dark">13</td>
<td style="background-color: #F0F0F0" class="dark">14</td>
<td style="background-color: #F6F6F6" class="dark">15</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFFFFF" class="dark">16</td>
</tr>
</table>

The color palette with neutral colors excluded:

![Linnaeus University Color Wheel](../image/lnu_wheel.png) {.wheel}
<table class="color-table-small">
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #333300" class="light">#333300</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFE000" class="dark">#FFE000</td>
<td style="background-color: #EFD200" class="dark">#EFD200</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFE003" class="dark">#FFE003</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFDF05" class="dark">#FFDF05</td>
</tr>
</table>

The color palette is primarily monochromatic, with the yellows being very close to one another on the color wheel, but with the dark olive green, very subtly available in the search icon and the hamburger button in the page's upper right hand corner, it is more of an analogous color scheme.
I have chosen to exclude the dark, purple-leaning blue from the analysis of the color palette, as it only seems to be visible on the website's front page as a border around the hamburger menu when you click on it. A range of gray shades is also used on the website.

The font used is **[Neue Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica#Neue_Helvetica_(1983))**, introduced in 1983 as a reworking of the original [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica) (created in 1957 by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffman). Compared to the original, Neue Helvetica is, among other changes, intended to have improved legibility.

| Element    | Font                            |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| H2:        | Helvetica Neue LT W05 35 Thin   |
| H2:        | Helvetica neue LT W05 75 Bold   |
| Body text: | Helvetica Neue LT W05 65 Medium |
|            | Helvetica Neue LT W05 45 Light  |
|            | Helvetica Neue LT W05 55 Roman  |

### Lund University

[![Lund University Front Page](../image/lu_preview.png)](../image/lu_frontpage.png) {.screenshot-preview}

When using the ColorZilla tool, the following colors were found on the front page of the website of Lund University, with the exception of color number 1, which I will explain further below:

<table class="color-table">
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #11377d" class="light">1</td>
<td style="background-color: #DEE2E6" class="dark">2</td>
<td style="background-color: #43423A" class="light">3</td>
<td style="background-color: #4D4C44" class="light">4</td>
<td style="background-color: #A6A5A1" class="dark">5</td>
<td style="background-color: #EBE8DE" class="dark">6</td>
<td style="background-color: #F2F0E9" class="dark">7</td>
<td style="background-color: #664D03" class="light">8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #FFECB5" class="dark">9</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFF3CD" class="dark">10</td>
<td style="background-color: #F9F8F5" class="dark">11</td>
<td style="background-color: #875E29" class="light">12</td>
<td style="background-color: #000" class="light">13</td>
<td style="background-color: #DBDBDA" class="dark">14</td>
<td style="background-color: #F2F1F0" class="dark">15</td>
<td style="background-color: #fff" class="dark">16</td>
</tr>
</table>

The color palette with neutral colors excluded:

![Lund University Color Wheel v2](../image/lu_wheel.png) {.wheel}
<table class="color-table-small">
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #11377d" class="light">#11377d</td>
<td style="background-color: #664D03" class="light">#664D03</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFECB5" class="dark">#FFECB5</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFF3CD" class="dark">#FFF3CD</td>
<td style="background-color: #875E29" class="light">#875E29</td>
</tr>
</table>

As mentioned above, color number 1, #11377d, was in fact not picked up by the ColorZilla tool, but I have still chosen to record it as part of the color palette, using ColorZilla's color picker. It can be found as the font color used for the university's name in the website's header, and considering that dark blue and bronze (represented here by color number 12, #875E29) are the university's official colors, I deemed it appropriate to include it in the palette above. That being said, it is worth noting that the dark blue, color number 1 above, only appears on the front page as that specific font color in the header image, and the dark blue is only included in the right color wheel above.

The color scheme appears to be a blend of monochromatic and analogous, with the bronze color, #875E29, being quite close to the other beige-brown colors in the palette. The dark blue, #11377d, acts as a complementary color. As shown above, a number of warm- and cool-toned grays are also used on the website.

The fonts used are **[Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface))**, a serif font designed in 1993 by Matthew Carter, intended to "appear elegant but legible when printed small or on low-resolution screens" and inspired by Scotch Roman designs of the 19th century, and **[Hind](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind)**, a sans serif font designed by Manushi Parikh in 2014 for the Indian Type Foundry, and available as an Open Source typeface at Google Fonts.

| Element    | Font          |
|------------|---------------|
| H2:        | Georgia       |
| H2:        | Georgia       |
| Body text: | Georgia       |
|            | Hind Regular  |
|            | Hind Bold     |

Analysis
-----------------------

All three websites are focused on being clear and informative - the color schemes are either monochromatic, analogous or what appears to be a blend of monochromatic and analogous, the contrast is good, and the fonts chosen are simple and stylish.

Blekinge Institute of Technology and Linnaeus University are both somewhat younger institutions, and one could speculate that this lends to them a larger freedom when it comes to designing their brands and, by extension, their websites. Both websites use sans serif fonts, and their color schemes are more explicit, with the dark aqua blues of the former and the bright yellows of the latter. 

The color choices of Blekinge Institute of Technology tie in well with their close proximity to water and their sustainability profile, with the blue green shades being reminiscent of deep seas. Blues can evoke a sense of calmness, stability and intelligence, and greens are usually seen as soothing, and are associated with nature, environment and renewal. While a dark blue can give a more traditional, conservative impression, the hint of green adds some freshness. The resulting combination, along with the font, gives a modern, marine feel to the website, and the contrasting orange, while very sparingly used, adds a pop of energy.

Linnaeus University have gone all in with very bright yellow shades. It's a very energetic, active, punchy color scheme, and as I understand it, yellow is the university's official color, and also the color of one of their main buildings. Such a strong yellow can be overpowering, but combined with the use of black, white and various gray shades, the website still manages to be quite balanced. The bold, energetic color choice, along with the simple sans serif font is without a doubt attention grabbing, and gives a modern, cheerful and youthful feel.

Lund University's website is dominated by the white background, but the bronze shade from the logo - a warm, earthy color that can give a sophisticated impression - is visible in links throughout the front page. The dark blue - as mentioned above, associated with calmness, stability and intelligence - is only visible in the header, but the white background allows the colors present to stand out without taking over. Along with the choice of a serif font in the headers, this website gives a more traditional impression, and if the bronze and dark blue had been given more room, it could easily have looked quite stuffy and conservative. The white background adds light and freshness, but it still remains well within what I imagine are the boundaries dictated by historical expectations.

I theorized above that the younger institutions may have a greater freedom when it comes to designing their brand, and their websites, and I feel that this is reflected in the difference between on one hand the websites belonging to Blekinge Institute of Technology and Linnaeus University, and on the other the website belonging to Lund University. The two former give a more modern impression, while the latter leans more conservative.
