Colors
=======================

The aim of this report is to analyze the color palette and typograhy on three separate websites.

Selection
-----------------------

The websites I have chosen for analysis are:

- **[Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se/)**
- **[Linnaeus University](https://www.lnu.se/)**
- **[Lund University](https://www.lu.se/)**

<br>
My reasons for choosing these websites are twofold: They are all websites belonging to Swedish universities or institutes of higher education, and they also happen to be universities or institutes of which I am a current or former student. They all have their own individual profiles and histories, and seeing as there are obvious similarities but also differences, I thought that this could make for an interesting selection for comparison.

Method
-----------------------

My method for performing this analysis has been to utilise the **[ColorZilla](https://www.colorzilla.com/)** browser extension in [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) in order to acquire the colors used on each website in a concise and comprehensive manner, the **[Adobe Color Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)** to help analyse the different color schemes, the built-in developer tools in Mozilla Firefox to acquire typographical information, and I have used **[LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/)** to capture the frontpage of each website's frontpage in its entirety.

Results
-----------------------

### Blekinge Institute of Technology

When using the ColorZilla tool, the following colors were found on the frontpage of the website of Blekinge Institute of Technology:

Monochromatic with a complementary signal color and a wide range of gray shades. Complementary?

The font used on the website is **[Averta](https://www.thedesignersfoundry.com/averta)**, a sans serif font designed by [Kostas Bartsokas](https://kostasbartsokas.com/). Averta is described as being modernist, neutral and friendly, and was created with versatility in mind.

### Linnaeus University

When using the ColorZilla tool, the following colors were found on the frontpage of the website of Linnaeus University:

<table class="color-table">
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #100169" class="light">1</td>
<td style="background-color: #333300" class="light">2</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFE000">3</td>
<td style="background-color: #EFD200">4</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFE003">5</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFDF05">6</td>
<td style="background-color: #000" class="light">7</td>
<td style="background-color: #212121" class="light">8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #333333" class="light">9</td>
<td style="background-color: #666666" class="light">10</td>
<td style="background-color: #C7C7C7">11</td>
<td style="background-color: #E6E6E6">12</td>
<td style="background-color: #EBEBEB">13</td>
<td style="background-color: #F0F0F0">14</td>
<td style="background-color: #F6F6F6">15</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFFFFF">16</td>
</tr>
</table>

The color palette could be described as a mixture of monochromatic and complementary, as there is on one hand four shades of yellow, a dark olive green, black and dark greys, and on the other hand a dark, purple-leaning blue, which acts as complement to the yellow shades. However, on the website's frontpage the dark blue only seems to be visible as a border around the hamburger menu in the upper right corner when you click on it, and because of this the palette can only really be described as monochromatic. Or is the dark olive green a contrasting color to the yellow analogous harmony?

The font used is **[Neue Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica#Neue_Helvetica_(1983))**, introduced in 1983 as a reworking of the original [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica) (created in 1957 by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffman). Compared to the original, Neue Helvetica is, among other changes, intended to have improved legibility.

- H2: Helvetica Neue LT W05 35 Thin
- H3: Helvetica neue LT W05 75 Bold
- Body text: 
  * Helvetica Neue LT W05 65 Medium
  * Helvetica Neue LT W05 45 Light
  * Helvetica Neue LT W05 55 Roman

### Lund University

When using the ColorZilla tool, the following colors were found on the frontpage of the website of Lund University, with the exception of color number 1, which I will explain further below:

<table class="color-table">
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #11377d" class="light">1</td>
<td style="background-color: #DEE2E6">2</td>
<td style="background-color: #43423A" class="light">3</td>
<td style="background-color: #4D4C44" class="light">4</td>
<td style="background-color: #A6A5A1">5</td>
<td style="background-color: #EBE8DE">6</td>
<td style="background-color: #F2F0E9">7</td>
<td style="background-color: #664D03" class="light">8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="background-color: #FFECB5">9</td>
<td style="background-color: #FFF3CD">10</td>
<td style="background-color: #F9F8F5">11</td>
<td style="background-color: #875E29" class="light">12</td>
<td style="background-color: #000" class="light">13</td>
<td style="background-color: #DBDBDA">14</td>
<td style="background-color: #F2F1F0">15</td>
<td style="background-color: #fff">16</td>
</tr>
</table>

As mentioned above, color number 1 was in fact not picked up by the ColorZilla tool, but I have still chosen to record it as part of the color palette. It can be found as the font color used for the university's name in the website's header, and as dark blue and bronze (represented here by color number 12) are the university's official colors, I deemed it appropriate to include it in the palette above. That being said, it is worth noting that the dark blue, color number 1 above, only appears on the front page as that specific font color in the header image.

The fonts used are **[Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface))**, a serif font designed in 1993 by Matthew Carter, intended to "appear elegant but legible when printed small or on low-resolution screens" and **[Hind](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind)**, a sans serif font designed by Manushi Parikh in 2014 for the Indian Type Foundry, and available as an Open Source typeface at Google Fonts.

  * Georgia
  * Hind Regular
  * Hind Bold
