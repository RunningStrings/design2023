Hi there!
==========================

My name is Annie Gustafsson, and this is my portfolio for the course [PA1436, Teknisk webbdesign och användbarhet](https://dbwebb.se/kurser/design-v3).

For a number of years I have been living in southern Östergötland, where I was born and raised, but I have also lived in Lund and Malmö, with a short stint in Växjö before that.

Previously I have studied law and literature, but I've always had a soft spot for this field - computers, problem solving, development - and I built some basic web sites when I was a teenager. When I discovered a little over a year ago that you can study web development remotely, it felt right, and so, here I am. There's a lot to learn, it's fast paced, and I'm having so much fun.

When I'm not studying and writing code, I enjoy running in nature, reading books, and taking photos.
